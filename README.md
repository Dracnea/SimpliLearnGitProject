# SimpliLearn Git Project
### The Git Project for Simplilearn:
This project involves the creation of a blog / personal style website meant to act as an online portfolio.

The main purpose of this project is to show off that I have learned about; HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, Javaascript, and the ability to version control with Git/Github.

The project is lacking JS due to in not necessarily being part of the requirement or example projects. It should be noted that this is a static website and that a real project would make use of JS, Java, and JSP to build a dynamic website.
