# SimpliLearn Git Project
### The Git Project for Simplilearn:
This project involves the creation of a blog / personal style website meant to act as an online portfolio.

The main purpose of this project is to show off that I have learned about; HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, Javaascript, and the ability to version control with Git/Github.

The project is lacking JS due to in not necessarily being part of the requirement or example projects. It should be noted that this is a static website and that a real project would make use of JS, Java, and JSP to build a dynamic website.

#### Home Page:
This page contains a simple greeting and some filler text. 

#### Blogs:
This page contains a listing of bootstrap cards that show shortened versions of blogs/articles. They will link to an actual full article page when the button within the card is clicked.

#### About:
This page currently has just filler content but would usually consists of information about myself.

#### Contact:
Here I have used a row-column grouping of cards to display all forms of contacting me. Currently all but my email are left blank for privacy and simplicity purposes.
